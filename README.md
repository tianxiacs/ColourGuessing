# ColourPicking
https://colour-picking-game.netlify.app \
A simple colour guessing game to practice JavaScript, responsive tiles,and DOM (No JQuery).

Check the RGB value and pick the correct colour tile.\
If the chosen one is wrong, the tile dims and fades into the background.\
When the right one is chosen, all tiles and the header turn to that colour.

The user has the option to choose the easy mode which has only 3 tiles. The default is hard mode which has 6 tiles.
